Recently on one fine afternoon, WhatsApp popped up a dialogue saying their privacy policy was changing once you agree they can read all of your chats making their end-to-end encryption completely useless.

Since most people, I communicate with are on WhatsApp it was impossible for me to immediately stop using WhatsApp as I did with Facebook a few years back and stay connected so having no choice but to agree to the new privacy policy.

I found signal.org from Twitter recommendations. it's a perfect app that ticks all of the checkboxes required to be a privacy-first communication app.

I thought of sharing it my contacts to spread awareness hoping at least a few might start using it and eventually like in earlier days we used to ask "are you on WhatsApp?" will be replaced by "are you on Signal?"

So I added my new WhatsApp status

after ~5 minutes I realized that strangely no-one had seen it, So I immediately checked it on my father's phone and to my surprise, it wasn't there, I immediately thought of connectivity issue and connected to my Wi-Fi hotspot but still nothing

then I thought let's check by adding another status so I added Test Status and that one popped up instantly, and to confirm this I immediately called my friend and asked him to confirm the same and send me screen record

below are the screen records from my dad's phone and my friend's status

## Conclusion

**Q:** After this new privacy policy can WhatsApp shadowban your status if it's convenient for them?
**A:** They can read your messages so maybe Yes

**Q:** Can I prove any of this legally?
**A:** No, I tried from some other phones and it worked. maybe it was just a bug, maybe this applies only to beta test users, or maybe they might be doing it a small number of times so nobody can prove this

**Q:** So is that shadowbanned status visible now?
**A:** No, it's not visible to anyone except me and will be gone within 24 hours
